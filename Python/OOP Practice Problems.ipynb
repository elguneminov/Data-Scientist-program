    "    In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y Rs. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 Rs individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you 120Rs. In fact this week’s prices are:\n",
